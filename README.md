This code is for the terminal Vim based file manager Ranger. Must have Ranger installed of course.

Copy contents from `commands.py` & `rc.conf` to the end of the respective files on your local Ranger installation.
Every class in the commands.py file is a separate functionality, so you can delete customize or delete to you liking. 

The rc.conf file are shortcut keybinds, those can be edited to your liking as well.

For the `runbuild` class/functionality to work, you'll need to set the paths marked with "/path/to/python/binary" in the both the class and contents in the `build` folder and terminal accordingly.
